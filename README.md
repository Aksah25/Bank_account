# Bank Account Management System in Java

## Overview
The **Bank Account Management System** is a Java application that simulates the core functionalities of a banking system while demonstrating the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It supports multiple account types and provides essential banking operations.

## Features
- Create bank accounts (Savings and Current).
- Deposit and withdraw funds.
- Check account balance.
- Transfer funds between accounts.
- View transaction history.
- Admin functionalities for account management.

## OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation**: Securely store account details within classes.
- **Inheritance**: Specialized classes for `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` extending the `Account` base class.
- **Polymorphism**: Override methods like `withdraw` for specific account rules.
- **Abstraction**: Simplify the interaction through well-defined methods in the base class.
